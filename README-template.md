## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Assignining values to CSS grid templated rows and columns highly depend on the type of design, using the same approach of lookup is not how it works.

## Acknowledgments

I worked on this project solely alone, i already had some decent concepts about CSS grids, hence i built it on my own, however some minor help to detect minute errors was needed for which i took help from AI bots.
